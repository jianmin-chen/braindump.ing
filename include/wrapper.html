          Hi, I'm JC! This is my blog where I like to braindump (hence the
          domain), mostly about technical things, because I want to get better
          at 1) technical things and 2) writing. You can find the source
          <a href="https://github.com/jianmin-chen/braindump.ing">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Questions? Something wrong? Want someone to talk to? (Ok, that last
          point is a little dubious.) Fire me an email at
          <code>jc[at]braindump[dot]ing</code> :)
