    <h1>Project: A Pixel Art Editor</h1>
    <div><p>The material from the <a target="_blank" href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/">previous</a> chapters gives you all the elements you need to build a basic web application. In this chapter, we will do just that.</p><blockquote><p>I look at the many colors before me. I look at my blank canvas. Then, I try to apply colors like words that shape poems, like notes that shape music.</p></blockquote><p>Our application will be a pixel-drawing program that allows you to modify a picture pixel by pixel by manipulating a zoomed-in view of it, shown as a grid of colored squares. You can use the program to open image files, scribble on them with your mouse or other pointer device, and save them. This is what it will look like:</p><img alt="" src="https://eloquentjavascript.net/img/pixel_editor.png"/><p>Painting on a computer is great. You don’t need to worry about materials, skill, or talent. You just start smearing and see where you end up.</p><p>The interface for the application shows a big <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element on top, with a number of form fields below it. The user draws on the picture by selecting a tool from a <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> field and then clicking, touching, or dragging across the canvas. There are tools for drawing single pixels or rectangles, for filling an area, and for picking a color from the picture.</p><h2 id="components"> Components<a class="link" href="#components"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h2><p>We will structure the editor interface as a number of <i>components</i>, objects that are responsible for a piece of the DOM and that may contain other components inside them.</p><p>The state of the application consists of the current picture, the selected tool, and the selected color. We’ll set things up so that the state lives in a single value and the interface components always base the way they look on the current state.</p><p>To see why this is important, let’s consider the alternative—distributing pieces of state throughout the interface. Up to a certain point, this is easier to program. We can just put in a color field and read its value when we need to know the current color.</p><p>But then we add the color picker—a tool that lets you click the picture to select the color of a given pixel. To keep the color field showing the correct color, that tool would have to know that the color field exists and update it whenever it picks a new color. If you ever add another place that makes the color visible , you have to update your color-changing code to keep that synchronized as well.</p><p>In effect, this creates a problem where each part of the interface needs to know about all other parts, which is not very modular. For small applications like the one in this chapter, that may not be a problem. For bigger projects, it can turn into a real nightmare.</p><p>To avoid this nightmare on principle, we’re going to be strict about <i>data flow</i>. There is a state, and the interface is drawn based on that state. An interface component may respond to user actions by updating the state, at which point the components get a chance to synchronize themselves with this new state.</p><p>In practice, each component is set up so that when it is given a new state, it also notifies its child components, insofar as those need to be updated. Setting this up is a bit of a hassle. Making this more convenient is the main selling point of many browser programming libraries. But for a small application like this, we can do it without such infrastructure.</p><p>Updates to the state are represented as objects, which we’ll call <i>actions</i>. Components may create such actions and <i>dispatch</i> them—give them to a central state management function. That function computes the next state, after which the interface components update themselves to this new state.</p><p>We’re taking the messy task of running a user interface and applying structure to it. Though the DOM-related pieces are still full of side effects, they are held up by a conceptually simple backbone: the state update cycle. The state determines what the DOM looks like, and the only way DOM events can change the state is by dispatching actions to the state.</p><p>There are <i>many</i> variants of this approach, each with its own benefits and problems, but their central idea is the same: state changes should go through a single well-defined channel, not happen all over the place.</p><p>Our components will be classes conforming to an interface. Their constructor is given a state—which may be the whole application state or some smaller value if it doesn’t need access to everything—and uses that to build up a <code>dom</code> property. This is the DOM element that represents the component. Most constructors will also take some other values that won’t change over time, such as the function they can use to dispatch an action.</p><p>Each component has a <code>syncState</code> method that is used to synchronize it to a new state value. The method takes one argument, the state, which is of the same type as the first argument to its constructor.</p><h2 id="the-state"> The state<a class="link" href="#the-state"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h2><p>The application state will be an object with <code>picture</code>, <code>tool</code>, and <code>color</code> properties. The picture is itself an object that stores the width, height, and pixel content of the picture. The pixels are stored in a single array, row by row, from top to bottom.</p><pre class="language-js"><div class="language-js">class Picture {</div><div class="language-js">  constructor(width, height, pixels) {</div><div class="language-js">    this.width = width;</div><div class="language-js">    this.height = height;</div><div class="language-js">    this.pixels = pixels;</div><div class="language-js">  }</div><div class="language-js">
</div><div class="language-js">  static empty(width, height, color) {</div><div class="language-js">    let pixels = new Array(width * height).fill(color);</div><div class="language-js">    return new Picture(width, height, pixels);</div><div class="language-js">  }</div><div class="language-js">
</div><div class="language-js">  pixel(x, y) {</div><div class="language-js">    return this.pixels[x + y * this.width];</div><div class="language-js">  }</div><div class="language-js">
</div><div class="language-js">  draw(pixels) {</div><div class="language-js">    let copy = this.pixels.slice();</div><div class="language-js">    for (let {x, y, color} of pixels) {</div><div class="language-js">      copy[x + y * this.width] = color;</div><div class="language-js">    }</div><div class="language-js">    return new Picture(this.width, this.height, copy);</div><div class="language-js">  }</div><div class="language-js">}</div></pre><p>We want to be able to treat a picture as an immutable value, for reasons we’ll get back to later in the chapter. But we also sometimes need to update a whole bunch of pixels at a time. To be able to do that, the class has a draw method that expects an array of updated pixels—objects with <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>color</code> properties—and creates a new picture with those pixels overwritten. This method uses <code>slice</code> without arguments to copy the entire pixel array—the start of the slice defaults to 0, and the end defaults to the array’s length.</p><p>The <code>empty</code> method uses two pieces of array functionality that we haven’t seen before. The <code>Array</code> constructor can be called with a number to create an empty array of the given length. The <code>fill</code> method can then be used to fill this array with a given value. These are used to create an array in which all pixels have the same color.</p><p>Colors are stored as strings containing traditional CSS color codes made up of a hash sign  followed by six hexadecimal  digits—two for the red component, two for the green component, and two for the blue component. This is a somewhat cryptic and inconvenient way to write colors, but it is the format the HTML color input field uses, and it can be used in the <code>fillStyle</code> property of a canvas drawing context, so for the ways we’ll use colors in this program, it is practical enough.</p><p>Black, where all components are zero, is written &quot;<code>#000000</code>&quot;, and bright pink looks like &quot;<code>#ff00ff</code>&quot;, where the red and blue components have the maximum value of 255, written <code>ff</code> in hexadecimal digits .</p><p>We’ll allow the interface to dispatch actions as objects whose properties overwrite the properties of the previous state. The color field, when the user changes it, could dispatch an object like <code>{color: field.value}</code>, from which this update function can compute a new state.</p><pre class="language-js"><div class="language-js">function updateState(state, action) {</div><div class="language-js">  return {...state, ...action};</div><div class="language-js">}</div></pre><p>This pattern, in which object spread is used to first add the properties an existing object and then override some of those, is common in JavaScript code that uses immutable objects.</p><p>This pattern, in which object spread is used to first add the properties an existing object and then override some of those, is common in JavaScript code that uses immutable objects.</p><h2 id="dom-building"> DOM building<a class="link" href="#dom-building"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h2><p>One of the main things that interface components do is create DOM structure. We again don’t want to directly use the verbose DOM methods for that, so here’s a slightly expanded version of the <code>elt</code> function:</p><pre class="language-js"><div class="language-js">function elt(type, props, ...children) {</div><div class="language-js">  let dom = document.createElement(type);</div><div class="language-js">  if (props) Object.assign(dom, props);</div><div class="language-js">  for (let child of children) {</div><div class="language-js">    if (typeof child != &quot;string&quot;) dom.appendChild(child);</div><div class="language-js">    else dom.appendChild(document.createTextNode(child));</div><div class="language-js">  }</div><div class="language-js">  return dom;</div><div class="language-js">}</div></pre><p>The main difference between this version and the one we used in <a href="/test">Chapter 16</a> is that it assigns properties to DOM nodes, not attributes. This means we can’t use it to set arbitrary attributes, but we can use it to set properties whose value isn’t a string, such as onclick, which can be set to a function to register a click event handler.</p><p>This allows this convenient style for registering event handlers:</p><pre class="language-html"><div class="language-html">&lt;body&gt;</div><div class="language-html">  &lt;script&gt;</div><div class="language-html">    document.body.appendChild(elt(&quot;button&quot;, {</div><div class="language-html">      onclick: () =&gt; console.log(&quot;click&quot;)</div><div class="language-html">    }, &quot;The button&quot;));</div><div class="language-html">  &lt;/script&gt;</div><div class="language-html">&lt;/body&gt;</div></pre><h2 id="the-canvas"> The canvas<a class="link" href="#the-canvas"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h2><p>The first component we’ll define is the part of the interface that displays the picture as a grid of colored boxes. This component is responsible for two things: showing a picture and communicating pointer events on that picture to the rest of the application.</p><p>Therefore, we can define it as a component that only knows about the current picture, not the whole application state. Because it doesn’t know how the application as a whole works, it cannot directly dispatch actions. Rather, when responding to pointer events, it calls a callback function provided by the code that created it, which will handle the application-specific parts.</p><pre class="language-js"><div class="language-js">const scale = 10;</div><div class="language-js">
</div><div class="language-js">class PictureCanvas {</div><div class="language-js">  constructor(picture, pointerDown) {</div><div class="language-js">    this.dom = elt(&quot;canvas&quot;, {</div><div class="language-js">      onmousedown: event =&gt; this.mouse(event, pointerDown),</div><div class="language-js">      ontouchstart: event =&gt; this.touch(event, pointerDown)</div><div class="language-js">    });</div><div class="language-js">    this.syncState(picture);</div><div class="language-js">  }</div><div class="language-js">  syncState(picture) {</div><div class="language-js">    if (this.picture == picture) return;</div><div class="language-js">    this.picture = picture;</div><div class="language-js">    drawPicture(this.picture, this.dom, scale);</div><div class="language-js">  }</div><div class="language-js">}</div></pre><p>We draw each pixel as a 10-by-10 square, as determined by the <code>scale</code> constant. To avoid unnecessary work, the component keeps track of its current picture and does a redraw only when <code>syncState</code> is given a new picture.</p><p>The actual drawing function sets the size of the canvas based on the scale and picture size and fills it with a series of squares, one for each pixel.</p><pre class="language-js"><div class="language-js">function drawPicture(picture, canvas, scale) {</div><div class="language-js">  canvas.width = picture.width * scale;</div><div class="language-js">  canvas.height = picture.height * scale;</div><div class="language-js">  let cx = canvas.getContext(&quot;2d&quot;);</div><div class="language-js">

They’ll be provided as an array of component constructors.</p><p>The <i>tools</i> do things like drawing pixels or filling in an area. The application shows the set of available tools as a <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> field. The currently selected tool determines what happens when the user interacts with the picture with a pointer device. The set of available tools is provided as an object that maps the names that appear in the drop-down field to functions that implement the tools. Such functions get a picture position, a current application state, and a dispatch function as arguments. They may return a move handler function that gets called with a new position and a current state when the pointer moves to a different pixel.</p><pre class="language-js"><div class="language-js">class PixelEditor {</div><div class="language-js">  constructor(state, config) {</div><div class="language-js">    let {tools, controls, dispatch} = config;</div><div class="language-js">    this.state = state;</div><div class="language-js">

An HTML <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element with a <code>type</code> attribute of <code>color</code> gives us a form field that is specialized for selecting colors. Such a field’s value is always a CSS color code in &quot;<code>#RRGGBB</code>&quot; format . The browser will show a color picker interface when the user interacts with it.</p><p>This control creates such a field and wires it up to stay synchronized with the application state’s <code>color</code> property.</p><pre class="language-js"><div class="language-js">class ColorSelect {</div><div class="language-js">  constructor(state, {dispatch}) {</div><div class="language-js">    this.input = elt(&quot;input&quot;, {</div><div class="language-js">      type: &quot;color&quot;,</div><div class="language-js">      value: state.color,</div><div class="language-js">      onchange: () =&gt; dispatch({color: this.input.value})</div><div class="language-js">    });</div><div class="language-js">    this.dom = elt(&quot;label&quot;, null, &quot;🎨 Color: &quot;, this.input);</div><div class="language-js">  }</div><div class="language-js">

It dispatches an action that updates the picture to a version in which the pointed-at pixel is given the currently selected color.</p><pre class="language-js"><div class="language-js">function draw(pos, state, dispatch) {</div><div class="language-js">  function drawPixel({x, y}, state) {</div><div class="language-js">    let drawn = {x, y, color: state.color};</div><div class="language-js">    dispatch({picture: state.picture.draw([drawn])});</div><div class="language-js">  }</div><div class="language-js">  drawPixel(pos, state);</div><div class="language-js">  return drawPixel;</div><div class="language-js">}</div></pre><p>The function immediately calls the <code>drawPixel</code> function but then also returns it so that it’s called again for newly touched pixels when the user drags or swipes over the picture.</p><p>To draw larger shapes, it can be useful to quickly create rectangles. The <code>rectangle</code> tool draws a rectangle between the point where you start dragging and the point that you drag to.</p><pre class="language-js"><div class="language-js">function rectangle(start, state, dispatch) {</div><div class="language-js">  function drawRectangle(pos) {</div><div class="language-js">    let xStart = Math.min(start.x, pos.x);</div><div class="language-js">    let yStart = Math.min(start.y, pos.y);</div><div class="language-js">    let xEnd = Math.max(start.x, pos.x);</div><div class="language-js">    let yEnd = Math.max(start.y, pos.y);</div><div class="language-js">    let drawn = [];</div><div class="language-js">    for (let y = yStart; y &lt;= yEnd; y++) {</div><div class="language-js">      for (let x = xStart; x &lt;= xEnd; x++) {</div><div class="language-js">        drawn.push({x, y, color: state.color});</div><div class="language-js">      }</div><div class="language-js">    }</div><div class="language-js">    dispatch({picture: state.picture.draw(drawn)});</div><div class="language-js">  }</div><div class="language-js">  drawRectangle(start);</div><div class="language-js">  return drawRectangle;</div><div class="language-js">}</div></pre><p>An important detail in this implementation is that when dragging, the rectangle is redrawn on the picture from the <i>original</i> state. That way, you can make the rectangle larger and smaller again while creating it, without the intermediate rectangles sticking around in the final picture. This is one of the reasons why immutable picture objects are useful—we’ll see another reason later.</p><p>Implementing flood fill is somewhat more involved. This is a tool that fills the pixel under the pointer and all adjacent pixels that have the same color. “Adjacent” means directly horizontally or vertically adjacent, not diagonally. This picture illustrates the set of pixels colored when the flood fill tool is used at the marked pixel:</p><img alt="" src="https://eloquentjavascript.net/img/flood-grid.svg"/><p>Interestingly, the way we’ll do this looks a bit like the pathfinding code from <a href="/test">Chapter 7</a>. Whereas that code searched through a graph to find a route, this code searches through a grid to find all “connected” pixels. The problem of keeping track of a branching set of possible routes is similar.</p><pre class="language-js"><div class="language-js">const around = [{dx: -1, dy: 0}, {dx: 1, dy: 0},</div><div class="language-js">                {dx: 0, dy: -1}, {dx: 0, dy: 1}];</div><div class="language-js">

For each pixel reached, we have to see whether any adjacent pixels have the same color and haven’t already been painted over. The loop counter lags behind the length of the <code>drawn</code> array as new pixels are added. Any pixels ahead of it still need to be explored. When it catches up with the length, no unexplored pixels remain, and the function is done.</p><p>The final tool is a color picker, which allows you to point at a color in the picture to use it as the current drawing color.</p><pre class="language-js"><div class="language-js">function pick(pos, state, dispatch) {</div><div class="language-js">  dispatch({color: state.picture.pixel(pos.x, pos.y)});</div><div class="language-js">}</div></pre><p>We can now test our application!</p><pre class="language-js"><div class="language-js">&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</div><div class="language-js">&lt;script&gt;</div><div class="language-js">  let state = {</div><div class="language-js">    tool: &quot;draw&quot;,</div><div class="language-js">    color: &quot;#000000&quot;,</div><div class="language-js">    picture: Picture.empty(60, 30, &quot;#f0f0f0&quot;)</div><div class="language-js">  };</div><div class="language-js">  let app = new PixelEditor(state, {</div><div class="language-js">    tools: {draw, fill, rectangle, pick},</div><div class="language-js">    controls: [ToolSelect, ColorSelect],</div><div class="language-js">    dispatch(action) {</div><div class="language-js">      state = updateState(state, action);</div><div class="language-js">      app.syncState(state);</div><div class="language-js">    }</div><div class="language-js">  });</div><div class="language-js">  document.querySelector(&quot;div&quot;).appendChild(app.dom);</div><div class="language-js">&lt;/script&gt;</div></pre><h2 id="saving-and-loading"> Saving and loading<a class="link" href="#saving-and-loading"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h2><p>When we’ve drawn our masterpiece, we’ll want to save it for later. We should add a button for downloading the current picture as an image file.

To create the image file, it uses a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element on which it draws the picture .</p><p>The <code>toDataURL</code> method on a canvas element creates a URL that uses the data: scheme. Unlike <code>http:</code> and <code>https</code>: URLs, data URLs contain the whole resource in the URL. They are usually very long, but they allow us to create working links to arbitrary pictures, right here in the browser.</p><p>To actually get the browser to download the picture, we then create a link element that points at this URL and has a <code>download</code> attribute. Such links, when clicked, make the browser show a file save dialog. We add that link to the document, simulate a click on it, and remove it again. You can do a lot with browser technology, but sometimes the way to do it is rather odd.</p><p>And it gets worse. We’ll also want to be able to load existing image files into our application. To do that, we again define a button component.</p><pre class="language-js"><div class="language-js">class LoadButton {</div><div class="language-js">  constructor(_, {dispatch}) {</div><div class="language-js">    this.dom = elt(&quot;button&quot;, {</div><div class="language-js">      onclick: () =&gt; startLoad(dispatch)</div><div class="language-js">    }, &quot;📁 Load&quot;);</div><div class="language-js">  }</div><div class="language-js">  syncState() {}</div><div class="language-js">}</div><div class="language-js">

But we don’t want the load button to look like a file input field, so we create the file input when the button is clicked and then pretend that this file input itself was clicked.</p><p>When the user has selected a file, we can use <code>FileReader</code> to get access to its contents, again as a data URL. That URL can be used to create an   <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element, but because we can’t get direct access to the pixels in such an image, we can’t create a Picture object from that.</p><pre class="language-js"><div class="language-js">function finishLoad(file, dispatch) {</div><div class="language-js">  if (file == null) return;</div><div class="language-js">  let reader = new FileReader();</div><div class="language-js">  reader.addEventListener(&quot;load&quot;, () =&gt; {</div><div class="language-js">    let image = elt(&quot;img&quot;, {</div><div class="language-js">      onload: () =&gt; dispatch({</div><div class="language-js">        picture: pictureFromImage(image)</div><div class="language-js">      }),</div><div class="language-js">      src: reader.result</div><div class="language-js">    });</div><div class="language-js">  });</div><div class="language-js">  reader.readAsDataURL(file);</div><div class="language-js">}</div></pre><p>To get access to the pixels, we must first draw the picture to a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element.

For each pixel in the rectangle specified by the arguments, it contains four values that represent the red, green, blue, and <i>alpha</i> components of the pixel’s color, as numbers between 0 and 255. The alpha part represents opacity—when it is 0, the pixel is fully transparent, and when it is 255, it is fully opaque. For our purpose, we can ignore it.</p><p>The two hexadecimal digits per component, as used in our color notation, correspond precisely to the 0 to 255 range—two base-16 digits can express 162 = 256 different numbers. The <code>toString</code> method of numbers can be given a base as an argument, so <code>n.toString(16)</code> will produce a string representation in base 16. We have to make sure that each number takes up two digits, so the hex helper function calls padStart to add a leading 0 when necessary.</p><p>We can load and save now!

The software you write for the browser can be run on almost every computer and phone on the planet.</p><p>At the same time, browser technology is ridiculous. You have to learn a large number of silly tricks and obscure facts to master it, and the default programming model it provides is so problematic that most programmers prefer to cover it in several layers of abstraction rather than deal with it directly.</p><p>While the situation is definitely improving, it mostly does so in the form of more elements being added to address shortcomings—creating even more complexity. A feature used by a million websites can’t really be replaced. Even if it could, it would be hard to decide what it should be replaced with.</p><p>Technology never exists in a vacuum—we’re constrained by our tools and the social, economic, and historical factors that produced them. This can be annoying, but it is generally more productive to try to build a good understanding of how the <i>existing</i> technical reality works—and why it is the way it is—than to rage against it or hold out for another reality.</p><p>New abstractions <i>can</i> be helpful. The component model and data flow convention I used in this chapter is a crude form of that. As mentioned, there are libraries that try to make user interface programming more pleasant. At the time of writing, <a href="/test">React</a> and <a href="/test">Svelte</a> are popular choices, but there’s a whole cottage industry of such frameworks. If you’re interested in programming web applications, I recommend investigating a few of them to understand how they work and what benefits they provide.</p></div>

          Hi, I'm JC! This is my blog where I like to braindump (hence the
          domain), mostly about technical things, because I want to get better
          at 1) technical things and 2) writing. You can find the source
          <a href="https://github.com/jianmin-chen/braindump.ing">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Questions? Something wrong? Want someone to talk to? (Ok, that last
          point is a little dubious.) Fire me an email at
          <code>jc[at]braindump[dot]ing</code> :)
