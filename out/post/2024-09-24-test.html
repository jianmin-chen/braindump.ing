    <h1>Getting started</h1>
    <div><p>In this series of articles, I want to show the way OpenGL works by writing its clone . Surprisingly enough, I often meet people who cannot overcome the initial hurdle of learning OpenGL / DirectX. Thus, I have prepared a short series of lectures, after which my students show quite good renderers.</p><p>So, the task is formulated as follows: using no third-party libraries , get something like this picture:</p><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/gh-pages/img/00-home/africanhead.png"/><p>Warning: this is a training material that will loosely repeat the structure of the OpenGL library. It will be a software renderer. I do not want to show how to write applications for OpenGL. I want to show how OpenGL works. I am deeply convinced that it is impossible to write efficient applications using 3D libraries without understanding this.</p><p>I will try to make the final code about 500 lines. My students need 10 to 20 programming hours to begin making such renderers. At the input, we get a test file with a polygonal wire + pictures with textures. At the output, we’ll get a rendered model. No graphical interface, the program simply generates an image.</p><p>Since the goal is to minimize external dependencies, I give my students just one class that allows working with  files. It’s one of the simplest formats that supports images in RGB/RGBA/black and white formats. So, as a starting point, we’ll obtain a simple way to work with pictures. You should note that the only functionality available at the very beginning  is the capability to set the color of one pixel.</p></div>

          Hi, I'm JC! This is my blog where I like to braindump (hence the
          domain), mostly about technical things, because I want to get better
          at 1) technical things and 2) writing. You can find the source
          <a href="https://github.com/jianmin-chen/braindump.ing">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Questions? Something wrong? Want someone to talk to? (Ok, that last
          point is a little dubious.) Fire me an email at
          <code>jc[at]braindump[dot]ing</code> :)
